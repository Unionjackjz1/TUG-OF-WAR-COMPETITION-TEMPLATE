# TUG-OF-WAR-COMPETITION-TEMPLATE

The SPUR-FLY freshman are little weebs who wanted a challenge. I dislike them personally, but this code works for them. I was forced to write this by one of the freshman. They are stupid, but eh, I don't really mind. 

So... yeah. To use this, just copy and paste. Its pretty idiot proof. Just don't be stupid you stupid freshman. Thanks.
